Array syntax
Reading[] readings= new Reading[5];

Indicate the type which is reading
The brackets indicate that it is an array
readings is the name of our variable
and we're allocating a new array of 5 readings

we can access each reading in an array using a for loop
STEPS IN DSA
1 Analysis, discovery, even real life applications as to why you would use this data structure
2 Next step is the implementation
Core storage of the data structure is an array then you have those operations that perform on that underlying  data structure.
3 Solving problems with it

DATA STRUCTURES
1 stack: The stack is the call stack anytime you call a function  it gets pushed to a STACK and then we have the QUEUE which is the message and also a piece of the runtime that deals with the order that your code executes.

2 Linked list are important to understand how pointers(references to data) work

3 Hash tables: we have a hashing function (it'll take some stringified key and return some integer between a range) an hashing function is a core component of a hash table


Algorithms in data structures

Time and space complexity

Space complexity: How much memory is used
Time complexity: How many  operations are executed to solve your problem

with respect to input size and assuming worst case scenarios
